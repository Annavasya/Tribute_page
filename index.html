    <p>"In November 1991, days before he died, Freddie Mercury met his manager to discuss how best to reveal to the world that he had Aids. Once they had agreed the wording of an announcement, the 45-year-old singer began to wonder how he would be remembered.
      "You can do what you want with my music," he said, "but don't make me boring." He got his wish. Twenty-one years later, Mercury is still the rock star's rock star, exerting enough magnetism to reel in new fans who are too young to remember him firsthand.
      There is a Hollywood biopic starring Sacha Baron Cohen, and a BBC documentary, The Great Pretender, tells the story of the last five years of his life. But why is there still so much interest? Is it his elusiveness? With Mercury, the curtain went
      up and came down again, leaving us none the wiser about his real life. He didn't live into the internet era, and so never had a chance to destroy his own mystique by tweeting and sharing. Twenty-first century rock stars are handmaidens to their
      fans, compelled to expose their lives to scrutiny, whereas, with Mercury, there was a kind of lordly absence of detail. If he was here now, they'd have wanted him to go on Dancing with the Stars and The X-Factor and you name it. He'd have hated
      that. People's lives are now open books – is there anything we don't know about Lady Gaga?" Freestone says. "But also, Queen's music is timeless. I was out last night and saw a Queen cover band, and there wasn't a single person in the audience who
      could have seen them live because they were too young. But every one of them was dancing and singing the words. He was enigmatic – everything he did raised questions he didn't answer."
